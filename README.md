# Knight Hacks React Firebase Workshop
This is the repository for all the code for the React / Firebase workshop for Knight Hacks. Link to the hosted app is: https://complete-chat-b7cff.firebaseapp.com/

### Initial Setup
For this workshop, you will need three things.
- Git which can be downloaded here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Node.js and NPM (It will install them both for you) at this link here: https://nodejs.org/en/
- Visual Studio Code (Not mandatory but will be what I'm going to use in the workshop) which you can download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- A gmail account which you can create here: https://www.google.com

Once you have those three things, clone this repo. Note that this repo is seperated into skeleton code and complete applicaition. Just a heads up if your reading this after the workshop has been given then the code in complete chat will no longer work since I'll be deleting it and removing that project from my personal account. Your free to use it for whatever you would want to, however, and would just need to swap out the project / api keys for one of your own.

Here are some helpful links I'll mention in the workshop that you can check out:
